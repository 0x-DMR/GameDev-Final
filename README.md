# GameDev-Final
Final Project for My Game Development Module.
***
This project took inspiration from classic games such as Pacman and Space Invaders to create a dystopian 3-D game used to shoot projectiles at enemy balls whilst trying to avoid getting hit from the enemeies. 
Within the repo is a list which contains the numerous sources which was used to help assist in developing this project.
